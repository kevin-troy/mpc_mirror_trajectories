# Pointing Mirror Trajectories
Linear Model Predictive Control (MPC) applied to a mirror for pointing trajectory generation and control simulation.

Applies Linear MPC with a linearized, discretized model of a pointing mirror. Enforces kinematic (state) and actuator (control) constraints. Includes simulation with of the Linear MPC controller with the full nonlinear system.
